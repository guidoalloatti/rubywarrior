This is my solution for the rubywarrior game.
Both difficulties where completed, both with an average grade of A for the tower.
There is a file called score on each directory where the results details can be verified.
The beginner have all the levels solutions one by one, but the intermediate runs directly on Epic Mode.

I hope you like it, scores are:
   -> Beginner: 592
   -> Intermediate: 962
